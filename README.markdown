About
=====

FiSyWiki (File System Wiki) is a simple text file based web publishing system with no web editing interface and no collaboration features. Users are expected to use other solutions (git, cvs, dropbox, ...) on top of it if used in a multi-user environment. Pages can be written in markdown, markdown extra and pure HTML. 

This system was developed for my own personal website and probably isn't production ready. Please use it at your own risk.

Dependencies
============

* PHP 5

Installation
============

Just drop the files on any HTTP acessible folder and you're good to go.

Usage
=====

* The pages folder contains all the documents, written in markdown, that can be accessed by the web browser. These pages should have no extension and can be structured using folders. The default file for each folder is named *index*.
* The themes folder contains a default theme defined using CSS. More themes can be added.
